# Simple Python script for crossposting Reddit posts to a discord channel
Uses a combination of PRAW and discord webhooks to do this

# SETUP
Make sure that you have PRAW and pycord installed on the machine you want to run this on. In order to use, change the example *.ini to their correct names and fill them with the required information. Any guide for how to setup a reddit bot will you get the information for how to make a read only bot (no writing to reddit is required).

# NOTE
There may be issues with the bot semi-randomly crashing. If this happens, feel free to post it as an issue so that I can fix it. Most of the general ones should already be covered, though.
